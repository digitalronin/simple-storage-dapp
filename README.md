# Simple Storage Dapp

This is a "full-stack" (i.e. smart contracts plus a web front-end) implementation of the simplest possible Dapp.

The smart contract stores and updates a "message" string, and the front-end displays the message and enables the user to update it with a new value.

## TODO

- Use a modal to force user to connect wallet
- Show the currently-connected chain
- Prompt the user to switch to a supported chain
- Make it mobile-friendly
- Replace favicon.ico and logoXXX.png
- refresh the app. if the user switches chains/accounts
- Disconnect if the user switches accounts in their wallet
- Deploy contracts to Rinkeby
- Deploy on Heroku/Github pages
- Stay connected on page refresh (if possible)
- Enable user to hit return in the input field to update the message
